```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
```


Should I merge the books to one text right away or would this make tracking pages more difficult?

```{r}
# Perhaps include other too volumes later as well
noo1 <- pdf_text("data/noo1.pdf")
noo2 <- pdf_text("data/noo2.pdf")

```


```{r}
glimpse(noo1)

summary(noo1)
```
